# Dijalog

Dijalog is a reimplementation of [HubSpot's vex](https://github.com/HubSpot/vex) as standalone micro library. I've been using vex for quite some time but it's dependency on jQuery has become a burden. Thus, I decided to reimplement it as standalone library in vanilla JavaScript.

Dijalog is a modern dialog library which is highly configurable and easily stylable. It has a tiny footprint, a small and simple API and works on mobile devices.

## Features

- Drop-in replacement for `alert`, `confirm`, and `prompt`.
- Easily configurable animations which are smooth as butter.
- Small (`3kb` minified and gzipped) and no dependencies.
- Looks and behaves great on mobile devices.
- Open multiple dialogs at once and close them individually or all at once.
- Built in CSS spinner for asynchronous dialogs.
- AMD and CommonJS support.

## Browser Support

- IE10+
- Firefox 30+
- Chrome 30+
- Safari 7+
